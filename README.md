## Docker
> **Docker**
:
*Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. - **Wikipedia***

You can download the desktop software by taking a look at this [link](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

In order to use the app you will have to install both ***Docker*** and ***Docker Compose***. The following instructions are compatible
with linux and macOs terminals.

1. Build the images with *Docker Compose*
```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

2. Run the container with *Docker Compose*
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
